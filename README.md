# Parametric Ellipse Fitting with Ceres

This repository is a reimplementation of ideas from https://github.com/pmkalshetti/ellipse_fitting and https://bitbucket.org/sergarrido/eigen_pr/src/block-lma-awf-expts/unsupported/test/ellipse_fitting.cpp.

Thanks to Andrew Fitzgibbon for the wonderful implementation.
